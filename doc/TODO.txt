-------------

Integrate Bosch BME sensor for at least temperature and humidity

-------------

Webpage

- Multiple dashboards for different data/charts?
   - 1 for Chart.js
   - 1 for HighCharts?
   or
   - 1 for SGP
   - 1 for BME?

- Make sliders for data rate
   - implies changing a lot of ESP code, since we have to broadcast different sensor data at different rates

-------------

Employ way more debug info on the ESP (like websocket onConnect)

-------------

External IoT service

Data upload to ubiquity or some other service
   --- via mqtt
   --- via websocket?
   --- InfluxDB?

-------------

Display

- control brightness
- multiple screens
   - cycle with hardware button
   - cycle with webpage button
   - config for timed cycling
   + Network Info
   + POST (at startup)
   + SGP Sensor
   + BME Sensor
   + Current config
